* Competitive Programming Codes
  This repository contains some templates for common competitive programming algorithms and data structures

  Codes are written for ~C++17~ standard (you may need to tweak some parts to run on older version)

  The templates in this repository aim toward abstraction. The goal is more copy-paste's and less edits.
